Team Charter
A Team Charter is a simple agreement that explains how a team will work together. It describes the team’s purpose, goals, roles, and responsibilities, so everyone knows what they are supposed to do. It also explains how the team communicates, makes decisions, and handles problems. By setting clear expectations, a Team Charter helps avoid confusion, improves teamwork, and keeps everyone focused on the same goals.

What a team charter usually includes
Purpose & goals – Why the team exists and what success looks like
Scope – What is in‑scope and out‑of‑scope for the team
Roles & responsibilities – Who does what
